# Learn Go – Practice Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on Go learning journey. It contains structured problem sets and solutions covering Go fundamentals including variables, data types, loops, arrays, slices, maps, functions, structs, JSON, error handling, and file handling.

Each topic folder includes multiple exercises implemented in Go to strengthen syntax understanding, logic building, and problem-solving ability.

## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

Most Go tutorials focus on syntax rather than practice.  
This repository bridges that gap by providing complete practice-based coverage of Go fundamentals, allowing consistent skill development through coding challenges.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Upcoming additions planned:

- Go concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- API development using `net/http`
- Database integrations
- Mini projects for backend workflows
